# üöÄ Fabric End-to-End Data Project

## üìò Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data pipeline** built using **Microsoft Fabric**, starting from data ingestion in **Azure Blob Storage**, processing and transformation through **Fabric Lakehouse** and **Notebooks**, and ending with data visualization in **Power BI**.  
The main goal of this project is to showcase a unified workflow that integrates all data engineering stages ‚Äî from extraction to insight delivery.

---

## üß© Architecture Overview
The architecture includes the following components:

- **Azure Resource Group** ‚Äì used to host and organize all project resources.
- **Fabric Capacity** ‚Äì enabled to manage workloads and connect multiple Fabric workspaces.
- **Azure Blob Storage** ‚Äì serves as the raw data source.
- **Fabric Workspaces (3 total)** ‚Äì used for data organization, pipeline creation, and Lakehouse management.
- **Fabric Pipelines** ‚Äì automate data movement from Blob Storage to Lakehouse.
- **Fabric Notebooks** ‚Äì used for data transformation and validation.
- **Power BI** ‚Äì for creating interactive dashboards and business insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Resource Group
- Created a new **Azure Resource Group** to hold all Fabric and storage resources.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Fabric Capacity
- Enabled **Fabric Capacity** within the resource group to allocate compute resources.
- Connected Fabric workspaces to this capacity for seamless performance.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Azure Blob Storage
- Created a **Blob Storage account** and a dedicated **container** to upload raw data.
- Uploaded CSV datasets into the container for further processing.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Link Fabric Workspaces
- Built **three Fabric workspaces** for structured data management.
- Each workspace connected to the same Fabric Capacity for centralized control.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Build Data Pipelines
- Designed **Fabric Pipelines** to automate the **ETL process**:
  - **Extract** data from Blob Storage.
  - **Load** it into the Lakehouse.
  - **Transform** and validate the data using Notebooks.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create Lakehouse and Load Data
- Built a **Fabric Lakehouse** to store the cleaned and structured data.
- Verified the successful data load using Fabric‚Äôs integrated viewer.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation with Fabric Notebooks
- Connected **Fabric Notebooks** to the Lakehouse for data transformation and validation.
- Performed cleaning, formatting, and schema adjustments to prepare data for visualization.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization in Power BI
- Integrated the final Lakehouse dataset with **Power BI**.
- Created interactive **dashboards and reports** to visualize insights and KPIs.
